CONCEPT

Library to syncronize JSON datasets using timestamps to automatically override conflicting data. It always assumes that the relevant data belonging to someone or update by someone is the most recent.
This will allow for simple apps from multiple different sources to work independently and still be able to syncronize at the same time without complex logic or time consuming operations.
Time is kept at key/value level so that each item is synced independently.

SCENARIO

Imagine a room with 4 entry points. At each entry point there is a person with an app validating who is allowed to enter the room. A regular app will validates everything with a central server so that every entry point seems the 
same data. However, if the connections fails or the server goes down, our access control app is rendered unusable. Chaos ensues. An app using json-timesync can be coded to work independently of a central server by keeping a 
copy of the relevant data and syncronizing everything once connection/server is restored. Since it overrides based on time, it *should* never fail or create a conflict. A server will be a simple relay for the sync, have 
other logic for dealing with the data or presenting a interface layer to a user.
